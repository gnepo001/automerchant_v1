Website with a Django backend and Next Js front end, mostly refamiliarizing myself with the process of creating an entire full stack website after a long hiatus. Definitely will be a v2 main project in the future!

Simple App that connects users to view and post up vehicles for sell.
Simple full stack app that can create users and profiles for users with cars and mods

Needs to add:

- user/account creation
- search bar with location limiter
- database
